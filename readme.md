# Shiro.js
## VERY EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT
A util package for my discord projects (and a fork of eris.js, since it is not maintained.)

> To import the package, do npm install shirojs

### This is not documented yet. I am going to work on it.

This is a util package, meaning it does not have a single purpose, but a bunch of things to make it easier for me.
